# StockPricePrediction

## Goal
The objective is to build models that predict stock price movements across different time scales and price thresholds. The model will generate a Buy/Sell/Hold recommendation based on these predictions.

### Recommendations:
1. **Buy:** The stock is expected to exceed a specified threshold.
2. **Sell:** The stock is expected to underperform by a specified threshold.
3. **Hold:** The stock is expected to fluctuate between the Buy and Sell thresholds.

### Example
- **Future time:** 2 weeks
- **Buy Threshold:** 5%
- **Sell Threshold:** 5%

**Interpretation:**  
The model outputs a Buy recommendation if it predicts that the stock price will increase by 5% or more within the next 2 weeks.
